<h2>Origin Story</h2>
<p>badaboom badaabing. When I was in preschool, someone took my cookie during snack time and my solution was to hit him with a brick left on the ground during recess. My cookies never got stolen after that day.</p>

<h2>Super Power</h2>
<p>I ate too many carrots as a baby so now my eyesight is unstoppable even though I don't like carrots anymore.</p>
